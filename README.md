# Logics-bank

## a side project to learn using java with MongoDB

### it's a simple bank mechanism which I still need to improve because it's very barebones right now

# Usage

## Prerequisites
- A MongoDB database running on an accessible machine or using MongoDB Atlas to create a database online [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPqRyYJmx2g).

#### Create a folder called whatever you like and move the jar below in that folder.
#### Then create a .env file in the same folder.
### Example .env:
```uri=your mongo database uri goes here``` -> [how to get your database uri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej05tq1220A)

#### after that run the jar file or open the terminal in the created folder and run 
```java -jar <jar-name>.jar```

### I do not guarantee that this is working properly. Please post any issues in github issues tab.
Thank you for using Logics bank!
